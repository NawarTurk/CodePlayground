<!-- The url_for function is used here to generate the URL for a static file, such as an image. 
By specifying 'static' as the first argument and the filename as the second, Flask ensures that the correct path to the static resource 
(e.g., 'puppy.jpg') is generated, even if the static folder is moved or renamed. -->
