SQL Varieties:
SQL databases are available in several flavors, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
SQLite Capacity:
SQLite is capable of handling up to around 100,000 hits per day, making it ideal for applications with moderate traffic.
Connecting Python Flask to SQL:
ORM (Object Relational Mapper): Using an ORM allows developers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python syntax rather than direct SQL commands.
Common ORM:
SQLAlchemy: This is a widely-used ORM that streamlines the process of performing database operations.
Flask Extension for SQLAlchemy:
Flask-SQLAlchemy: This extension makes it easier to integrate SQLAlchemy into a Flask application.
Installation:
To enable Flask to connect to an SQL database using SQLAlchemy, install the necessary extension:


pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

Steps to Integrate SQLAlchemy with Flask:
Set Up the SQLite Database in a Flask Application: 1.1. Initialize the Flask application. 1.2. Configure the application to use SQLAlchemy. 1.3. Instantiate the SQLAlchemy class with the application object.

Create a Model in the Flask Application:

Models represent tables in the database. Instead of creating tables directly, define model classes that SQLAlchemy will use to generate the tables.
Inherit from db.Model.
Define table columns as class attributes.
Implement methods for initialization and representation.
Perform Basic CRUD Operations on the Model:

Add, read, update, and delete records using the model through Python code rather than SQL statements.
